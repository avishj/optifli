# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork and set up the dev environment:

   Install [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) if not already available, then:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/optifli.git
   cd optifli
   uv sync
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature
   ```

2. Make your changes and verify everything passes:

   ```bash
   just ci
   ```

3. Commit using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with a [sign-off](https://developercertificate.org/):

   ```bash
   git commit -s -m "feat: add cool feature"
   ```

4. Push and open a pull request against `main`.

## Guidelines

- **Open an issue first** for non-trivial changes to discuss the approach.
- **Keep PRs focused** with one logical change per PR.
- **Add tests** for new functionality.
- **Follow existing code style** enforced by pre-commit hooks and CI.

## IDE Integration

Install [SonarQube for IDE](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) for real-time code quality feedback. Connect it to SonarCloud in **Connected Mode** to sync the project's quality profile and rules:

1. Install the SonarQube for IDE extension for your editor
2. Add a SonarCloud connection using your token
3. Bind your local project to the SonarCloud project

This gives you the same rules that run in CI directly in your editor, catching issues before you even commit.

## Reporting Bugs

Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/avishj/optifli/issues/new/choose) using the appropriate template.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for reporting vulnerabilities.
