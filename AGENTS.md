# MUST FOLLOW RULES

1. MUST ALWAYS use uv for all python related commands.
2. MUST ALWAYS run commands with rtk <command>, every command is guaranteed to be proxied through it.
3. MUST ALWAYS use skill before git add/commit.
4. MUST ALWAYS add and commit in the same command (both need their own rtk).
5. Pre-commit failure ALWAYS BLOCKS commit. Fix unless autofixed and retry commit.
